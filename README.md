# ProjetHMSN204

Everything here was done for a school project which needed us to implement a database and create, with python, a script which would be able to align genetic sequences. 
We used, for the database, ProgreSQL, because it's easier to use. 

In this github, you will find :
-This readme
-The python script
-The create tables which were used to create the database

The project is considered to be finished.
